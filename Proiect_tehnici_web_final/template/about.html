            <p>As we have seen over the past year, Jordan Brand has been expanding internationally.

                After the brand’s recent Jordan 16 SongGao store opening in Taipei, Taiwan, it was only a matter of time before JB hit the mainland. Beijing’s newest landmark is the brand new Jordan 9 Guanghua flagship store, located at the center of the Beijing World Trade area.</p>

            <p>Not only is brand new store state of the art, it’s also Asia’s largest Jordan store to date. Since branching off and creating its own identity in 1998, Jordan Brand has spearheaded into Asia with enormous brick and mortar retail locations. Moreover, Jordan Brand recently signed its first Chinese player, Guo Ailun.

                “With its unique basketball and sneaker culture, Beijing is a natural fit for the brand’s presence in China,” said Larry Miller, President of Jordan Brand, in a statement. “We are excited to bring Jordan Brand’s vision to life in Beijing by creating a retail experience that not only pays homage to the brand’s legacy and the city’s culture, but also inspires the future.”

                According to Nike, the new Jordan 9 Guanghua store will serve as a key source for pinnacle products and personalized Jordan experiences in mainland China. The store includes a Jordan Flight Lab, a court where customers can test new sneakers with the guidance of Jordan certified store athletes, and hyperlocal product customization services that will debut the Beijing Icons, inspired by local Beijing courts and landmarks.

                Let us know if you stop by the brand new Jordan 9 Guanghua store.</p>

                    <p>The Air Yeezy 2 SP ‘Red October’ stands out from its two companion colorways. There’s the monochromatic scarlet finish, contrasted only by metallic gold lace tips. There’s the unique design, which sees the side panels ditch the standard anaconda texture in favor of rows upon rows of small triangular studs. Finally, there’s the chaos that surrounded the shoe’s much-delayed release. By the time the Red Octobers finally launched online with no advance notice in February 2014, Kanye West had already severed all ties with Nike.</p>

                    <h1>Nike Mag; The world's most expensive Nike shoe <em>Price: 595,214$</em></h1>

                    <p>The Nike Mag, complete with “Adaptive Fit,” to be released in partnership with The Michael J. Fox Foundation in effort to speed a cure for Parkinson’s. Nike took the first step in bringing adaptive footwear into more sports this spring with the introduction of the Nike HyperAdapt 1.0, a performance shoe that automatically laces and fits to the unique shape of each athlete’s foot.

                        The 2016 Nike Mag combines the archetype invention with new technologies developed for the HyperAdapt 1.0. The result is an individually responsive system, called Adaptive Fit, that senses the wearer and tightens or loosens accordingly.</p>
